        <p> Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, located in West Africa along
            the Gulf of Guinea. It is known as the "Giant of Africa" because of its large population (over 220 million
            people) and strong cultural, economic, and
            political influence. Nigeria is made up of over 250 ethnic groups, with Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo being the
            three largest. The country is rich in natural resources, especially oil and gas, and has a diverse cultural
            heritage expressed
            through languages, music, art, and festivals. Its capital city is Abuja, while Lagos is the largest city and
            major economic hub.
