        <h2>Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="images/nigeria.jpg" <p> Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, located in West Africa along
        the
        Gulf of Guinea. It is known as the
        "Giant of Africa" because of its large population (over 220 million people) and strong cultural, economic, and
        political
        influence. Nigeria is made up of over 250 ethnic groups, with Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo being the three largest.
        The
        country is rich in natural resources, especially oil and gas, and has a diverse cultural heritage expressed
        through
        languages, music, art, and festivals. Its capital city is Abuja, while Lagos is the largest city and a major
        economic
        hub.</p>
